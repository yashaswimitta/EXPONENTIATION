# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.
3. Print the output.
4. End of the program

## Program:
```
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: Yashaswi Mitta
#RegisterNumber: 21002549
def exp(a,b):
    c=a**b
    return c
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",exp(a,b))
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
